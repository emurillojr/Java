<b>Problem - LinkedLists</b>  
Create a program that has two instances of LinkedList.    
•	The first instance will be called stadiumNames and will hold items of type String.  (LinkedList<String>)  
•	The second instance is gameRevenue and will hold items of type Double.  (LinkedList<Double>)  
Within a loop, read data for the ball games played during a season. The data for a game consists of a stadium name and the amount of money made for that game.  Add the game data to stadiumNames and gameRevenue.  [Note, one stadium can have multiple games].  
After reading the data for all of the games, ask the user for a stadium name and display the total amount of money made for all of the games at that stadium.  
A sample output is:  
Enter the data now.   
On each line enter a stadium name and the game revenue  
Enter done when you are finished  
Giants 1000
