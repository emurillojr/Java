In class assignments from course

Assignment 1  
Create a program that does the following:  
Has two input variables of type double  
input1  
input2  
Has two output variables (both get the value input1 * input2)  
Result (type double)  
Result (type int)  
Output the two output variables  

Assignment 2  
Part 1  
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the distance to drive, the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon, and the price per gallon, and displays the cost of the trip.  
You do not have to worry about the user entering invalid data.  
Sample output  
Enter the driving distance: 100  
Enter miles per gallon: 20  
Enter price per gallon: 3.61  
The cost of driving is $18.05  
  
Enter the driving distance: 40.4  
Enter miles per gallon: 23.2  
Enter price per gallon: 3.74  
The cost of driving is $6.512758620689656  
  
  
Part 2  
Write a program that asks the user for words, in three steps (i.e. prompt the user for one word, read it, then get the second word and then the third).  
Store the three words in your program two ways.  
1)	As one String variable  
2)	As a StringBuffer variable  
Output both the String variable and the StringBuffer variable.  
Sample output  
Enter three words:  
one  
two  
three  
Concatenated String = onetwothree  
StringBuffer = onetwothree
